# FScape UI

## Layout

It should be possible to use `Empty()`, for example with `GridPanel`, instead of having
to fall back to `Label("")`.

## Special Functionality

- [ ] detecting path-field changes, setting background colour
      (output blue for existing file, input red for non-existing file)
- [ ] detecting path-field changes, populating format field
- [ ] (un)linking path-field names ("auto-generate" output names)
- [ ] other forms of linking; e.g. output path extension should determine format,
      and format change should change the path extension.
- [X] drag and drop files (artifacts) across path-fields, from desktop to path-field

## Cosmetics

- path-field should use maximum width available; seems to cling to "preferred-size"

## Graphemes

They would naturally replace the envelope editors.
